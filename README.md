## Overview
MobilityCorp is a multi-modal urban mobility provider offering short-term rentals of electric scooters, eBikes, electric cars, and electric vans across multiple city and suburban locations throughout the European Union. The company operates a "last-mile transport" model where customers can book vehicles on-demand through a mobile app, access them via NFC technology, and return them to designated parking spots.

### Core Business Challenges
MobilityCorp faces three interconnected challenges that directly impact revenue, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. Customers can't find vehicles when they need them, vehicles run out of power mid-service, and users treat the service as a occasional convenience rather than a reliable daily transportation option. These issues stem from reactive operations rather than predictive, data-driven decision making.
