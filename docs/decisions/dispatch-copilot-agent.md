# Operations Copilot Agent

## Context and Problem Statement

MobilityCorp’s field operations team will rely on static daily route plans <!-- Task list? preplanned route? --> generated by the Demand Forecast and Vehicle Recharge Models. But real-world and real-time conditions--such as weather, traffic, or sudden reservation spikes--have the potential to invalidate our static forecasting plans, leading to missed opportunities or inefficiencies in routing. Currently, any field ops team would be asked to recalculate priorities manually while in the field, with very little tracebility around why such decisions were made. <!-- I had previously made this present tense, that an ops team is currently recalculating priorities manually. But not sure if that's a correct assumption -->

The Copilot should coordinate deterministic plans, suggest updates based on real-time data, and summarize context conversationally to empower the field team with up to date information that will drive their operational decisions.

## Decision Drivers

MobilityCorp's priorities include:

- Operational responsiveness
- Human-in-the-loop safety
- Reduce manual dispatcher load
- Intuitive, conversational UX
- Comprehensive automated testing
- Auditability and compliance
- Use of modern, prevalent tools

## Considered Options

- Conversational Operations Agent (chat-based with push prompts)
- Static Daily Route planning
- Fully Autonomous Agent Re-Planning
- Manual Dispatcher-Only Coordination

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Conversational Operations Copilot Agent", because it balances real-time automation with human oversight, providing field staff an intuitive, conversational interface that adapts to live operational triggers while preseving safety, auditability and control.

### Confirmation

{Describe how the implementation / compliance of the ADR can/will be confirmed. Is there any automated or manual fitness function? If so, list it and explain how it is applied. Is the chosen design and its implementation in line with the decision? E.g., a design/code review or a test with a library such as ArchUnit can help validate this. Note that although we classify this element as optional, it is included in many ADRs.}

- Every proposal or plan requires human-in-the-loop approval before execution
- User feedback metrics such as approval rates, response latency and satisfation scores are monifored as fitness indications in production

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Conversational Operations Agent

An AI-assisted, chat-based workflow layer embedded in the ops mobile app that delivers live route updates, contextual explanations, and proactive push prompts when forecasts or triggers suggest operational changes. The agent coordinates with deterministic planners and requires human approval for all actions.

- Good, because users receive contextual updates and conversational explanations rather than static task lists
- Good, because proactive push prompts improve situational awareness and reduce idle time
- Good, because user and field coordination load decreases while still preserving human agency and control
- Good, because feedback is now captured in structured form for analytics
- Bad, because chat orchestration and message moderation add infrastructure complexity

### Static Daily Route planning

Routes are generated once per day based on forecasted demand for the next day. Each field operator receives a fixed route for the day via the ops mobile app. There is no re-planning or dynamic adjustment. Any changes require dispatcher intervention.

- Good, because it's simple and comparatively low-cost to implement
- Good, because daily route generation can be validated easily with minimal infrastructure
- Bad, because it cannot adapt to real-time weather, demand, or traffic changes once routes are issued
- Bad, because users cannot provide feedback or request a rerouting
- Bad, because lacks context and adaptability
- Bad, because dispatchers must manually coordinate route deviations

### Fully Autonomous Agent Re-Planning

An autonomous LLM agent that continuously monitors and executes operational routes (without human approval). It could _theoretically_ optimize efficiency but introduces high compliance and safety risk.

- Good, because it maximizes automation
- Bad, because it is nondeterministic and difficult to validate
- Bad, because because human operators lose visibility and trust in system decisions
- Bad, because it is nondeterministic and difficult to audit or validate

### Manual Dispatcher-Only Coordination

All decisions and route adjustments are handled manually by human dispatchers. System automation is limited to reporting and static scheduling.

- Good, because it requires no new technology investment or integration
- Good, because human dispatchers maintain full control of all operational changes
- Bad, because because it increases dispatcher workload and communication overhead
- Bad, because non scaleable and error prone
- Bad, because it's slow to react to real-time triggers
- Bad, because it lacks data capture for improvements
